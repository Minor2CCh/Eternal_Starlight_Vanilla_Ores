# About
This is an unofficial add-on to [Eternal Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/eternal-starlight) that produces seven vanilla ores in addition to redstone ores in the Eternal Starlight Dimension underground.
With this mod, you can increase the amount of resources you can acquire by exploring Eternal Starlight's underground.
Also, even if you have acquired a lot of ore in the overworld and your ore resources are depleted, you can acquire vanilla ore again as a side trip in your search for Eternal Starlight.

# Feature
Ore production is similar to that of vanilla, but some biomes produce more of certain ores. If there is an ore you want, you may want to concentrate your search on a particular biome.
There are also four ore types: Grimstone, Voidstone, Eternal Ice, and Haze Ice. Each type is assigned to each location where it is generated.
Eternal Ice and Haze Ice take slightly longer to refine than the other types.

# Reduce Ore Config (After 1.1.0)

## Fabric

Open the file “eternal_starlight_vo.json” in the config directory and change the parameters to reduce ore production.
ReduceOres“ (default:false) reduces the frequency of pure ore production, while ”ExtraOrePerBiome" (default:true) can be used to increase the production of some ores in a characteristic biome.

## NeoForge

The amount of ore produced can be reduced by applying the datapack attached to the project page. The contents of each pack are as follows

 - lite.zip

Reduces the amount of ore produced.

 - non_extra.zip

It will no longer increase the amount of ore per biome.

- lite_non_extra.zip

Reduces the amount of ore produced and eliminates the increase in ore per biome.
