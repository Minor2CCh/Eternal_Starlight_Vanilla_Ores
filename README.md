# About
This is an unofficial add-on to [Eternal Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/eternal-starlight) that produces seven vanilla ores in addition to redstone ores in the Eternal Starlight Dimension underground.
With this mod, you can increase the amount of resources you can acquire by exploring Eternal Starlight's underground.
Also, even if you have acquired a lot of ore in the overworld and your ore resources are depleted, you can acquire vanilla ore again as a side trip in your search for Eternal Starlight.

# Feature
Ore production is similar to that of vanilla, but some biomes produce more of certain ores. If there is an ore you want, you may want to concentrate your search on a particular biome.
There are also four ore types: Grimstone, Voidstone, Eternal Ice, and Haze Ice. Each type is assigned to each location where it is generated.
Eternal Ice and Haze Ice take slightly longer to refine than the other types.
